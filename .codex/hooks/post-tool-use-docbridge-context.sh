# file that was just edited, so the agent reconciles the edit with the linked
# specification (or code) before moving on.
#
# PostToolUse, not PreToolUse: Claude Code delivers a PreToolUse hook's
# additionalContext next to the tool result (after the edit runs), so it cannot
# enforce read-before-editing. Delivering it right after the edit is the honest,
# documented behavior.
#
# Wire it to the Edit and Write tools in .claude/settings.json; see the README
# in this directory. Requires bash, git, bun, and the DocBridge CLI.
